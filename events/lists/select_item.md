# Select Item

Fire whenever a user clicks on a product link found in a list that forwards the user to the product detail page. List types include cards, search, promotions, and similar component.

If the site is not currently able to support differentiating products from content, then add the attributes/event for **[select_content](select content)** instead and add a dev task to update the site to enable this differentiation.

Do not fire this event for product links found in menus.
