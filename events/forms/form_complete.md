# Form Complete

Fire whenever a user successfully completes a form. 

This event is fired when form input is successfully received and process. This is in contrast to `form_error` which occurs when a submission is attempted but an error occurs and the form input is not recieved and processed.

## Javascript Code

```js
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
dataLayer.push({
  event: 'form_complete',
  event_specific_id: '<event_specific_id>',
  event_specific_name: '<event_specific_name>',
});
```
