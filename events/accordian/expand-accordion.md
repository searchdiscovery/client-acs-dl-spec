# Expand Accordion

Fire whenever a user expands an accordion item.

If using data attributes, the `data-layer-event` attribute should be dynamically updated from `collapse_accordion` to `expand_accordion` whenever the accordion is collapsed so this event will fire.

## HTML Data Attributes

```html
<a href="<link_url>"
  data-layer-event="expand_accordion",
  data-layer-accordion_id="<accordion_id>"
  data-layer-accordion_name="<accordion_name>"
  data-layer-slot="<slot>"
>
```
## Javascript Code

```js
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
dataLayer.push({ event_data: null });  // Clear the previous event_data object.
dataLayer.push({
  event: "expand_accordion",
  event_data: {
    accordion_id: "<accordion_id>",
    accordion_name: "<accordion_name>",
    accordion_heading: "<accordion_heading>",
    slot: "<slot>",
  }
});
```
