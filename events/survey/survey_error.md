# Survey Error

Fire whenever a user unsuccessfully completes a survey. 

This is in contrast to [`complete_survey`](survey/complete_survey.md) which occurs when a submission succeeds.

## Javascript Code

```js
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
dataLayer.push({
  event: 'survey_error',
  error: '<error>',
  event_specific_id: '<event_specific_id>',
  event_specific_name: '<event_specific_name>',
});
```
