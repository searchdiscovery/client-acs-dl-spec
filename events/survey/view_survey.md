# View Survey

Fire whenever a user is presented with a survey on a page.

## HTML Data Attributes

This could be done with data attributes and detected via GTM at DOM Ready, but if a survey is dynamically added to the page at any time, it would not be picked up. As such, manually firing the data layer push whenever a survey is loaded is a more reliable approach.

## Javascript Code

```js
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
dataLayer.push({ event_data: null });  // Clear the previous event_data object.
dataLayer.push({
  event: 'view_survey',
  event_data: {
    event_specific_id: '<event_specific_id>',
    event_specific_name: '<event_specific_name>',
    event_specific_type: '<event_specific_type>'
  }
});
```

## Variable Definitions

|Field|Type|Required|Description|Example|Pattern|Min Length|Max Length|Minimum|Maximum|Multiple Of|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|event_specific_id|string|recommended|The survey machine-readable name. This should be a unique value specific to this survey, if one exists. If one does not exist, this can also be populated with the same value as the `event_specific_name`.|cancel_subscription_flow, free_trial|
|event_specific_name|string|required|The survey human-readable name. This should be something that an analyst without a deep knowledge of the technical implementation of the site can easily identify the survey with. It should be lowercase snake_case.|cancel_subscription_flow, free_trial|
|event_specific_type|string|required|The survey type. This will act as a filtering mechanism in reporting to enable analysts to view survey droppoff funnels. It can also act as an internal aid in firing additional events if necessary. For instance, lead-generating surveys require a `generate_lead` event to be fired alongside `complete_survey`, and that could be written into the logic based upon this field.|survey, lead_generation|
