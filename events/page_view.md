# Page View

Fire whenever a user loads in a new page, whether that is done synchronously or asynchronously.

This event should be the first pushed into the data layer on each page. Given many 3rd party scripts push events to the data layer, this event push should be placed in the page `<head>` and should be the first `<script>` tag on the page to ensure it is the first event.

There is no longer a concept of virtual page view, so this event should be fired whenever a virtual page view would have been fired in the past, such as when a new screen is loaded asyncronously within an angular, react, or vue app/embed.

## Javascript Code

```js
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
dataLayer.push({ page_data: null });  // Clear the previous event_data object.
dataLayer.push({
  event: '<page_view>',
  page_data: {
    brand: '<brand>',
    country: '<country>',
    language: '<language>',
    page_category: '<page_category>',
    page_location: '<page_location>',
    page_referrer: '<page_referrer>', 
    page_title: '<page_title>',
    region: '<region>',
    site_section: '<site_section>',
  },
  user_data: {
    user_id: '<user_id>',
    user_login_state: '<user_login_state>',
  }
});
```
