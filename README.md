# ACS Data Layer Spec

## Overview
This repository contains the necessary specifications to build an Event Driven Data Layer.

## Data Layer
Each file inside the **[events](events)** folder corresponds to a single use case or site event that needs to be implemented.

These will be used to share data with the tag management tool of choice and to trigger the corresponding tracking events in the analytics tool of choice.
